# Tutorial topic:   Objects in R

# The basis of R programming consists in assigning values to objects and
# manipulating those objects. Most simply, R is just a calculator

2 + 3

# That calculation runs in the console. But we can save the value in an object
# which is stored in memory. To do so we use the assignment operator, <-.  
# (= works too).

x <- 2 + 3

x

x + x

# There is always more than one way to do things in R! We can use a built in
# function also.

sum(x, x)

x * x

product(x, x)

x^2 

y <- x + x

# Question:  What is the value of y?

y
