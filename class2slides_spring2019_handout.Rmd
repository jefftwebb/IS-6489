## Tonight's agenda

- Details
- Questions about the course or the material?
- Live poll review
- Review: tidy data
- Review:  Why EDA?
- EDA workflow
- .Rmd script on tidy data and EDA workflow; mini-project.
- Note:  My assumption tonight is that you've studied the lecture and tutorial videos for week 2 and are ready to practice the concepts and techniques covered there. 

# Details 

## Details

- My office hours: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM Tuesday or by appointment.
- TA Ali Samanazari: ali.samanazari at utah.edu. Ali will conduct weekly tutorial sessions on Mondays, 5 - 6 PM in SFEBB 5163.  Please also feel free to email him with any questions about R programming or other course content.
- Homework coming up is *Introduction to the Tidyverse* at Datacamp.  If you want more to do I would suggest additional courses in dplyr, ggplot2 or tidyverse.

# Tidy data

## Messy data
- As noted:  all messy datasets are messy in their own way, which makes it hard to generalize about how to fix them. 
- Nevertheless, here are some guidelines for tidy data:
    1. Each variable must have its own column.
    2. Each observation must have its own row (meaning that each value must have its own cell).
    3. A table should be dedicated to same observational unit.
- Adapted from *R for Data Science* by Wickham and Grolemund.    

## Messy data

Tuberculosis cases and population by country and year. What's messy here?

```{r}
data(table2)

table2

```


## Messy data

What's messy here?

```{r}
data(table3)

table3

```

## Messy data

What's messy here?

```{r}
data(table4a)

table4a

```

## Tidy data

```{r}
data(table1)

table1

```

# Why EDA?

## Reminder:  Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

## Simpson's paradox

```{r include=F}
simpsons <- read.csv("simpsons_data.csv")[,-1]

```

```{r include=T, echo =F}
head(simpsons, 15) %>% kable
```

## Simpson's paradox

```{r echo=F}
ggplot(simpsons, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Simpson's paradox

```{r echo=F}
ggplot(simpsons, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", col=2, se=F) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Simpson's paradox

```{r echo=F}
ggplot(simpsons, aes(x, y, col=group, group=group)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", se=F, col = 1) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Why EDA?

- We explore the data prior to fitting a model so that we understand the idiosyncrasies of the data and can make informed modelling decisions.
- In the case of Simpson's paradox data we may be interested in the relationship between x and y, but through EDA we (hopefully) learn that we need to examine the relationship between x and y *within* each group.

## EDA workflow

After understanding the business context and the motivating business problem for the analysis:

1. Formulate a question 
2. Read in your data 
3. Check the packaging 
4. Inspect dataset:  str(), glimpse(), View()
5. Look at the top and the bottom of your data 
6. Summarize the data 
7. Try the easy solution first 
8. Challenge your solution
9. Follow up questions
